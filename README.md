This just stores a bunch of useful code bits and some ease of use functions

- utils.py
 - Contains many functions for doing moving averages, histograms and some plotting routines
- wordshuffle.py
 - takes an string and shuffles the middle letters in each character. And you can still read it!
- myhelpers.py
 - some color parsing stuff for a function in utils.py. Eventually all the plotting stuff will be split off
- schmidt_funcs.py
 - the only generally useful thing in here is a way to make jupyter notebooks print output immediately (_it's stupid that it doesn't do that anyway_)
